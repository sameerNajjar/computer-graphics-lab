# week 1
    learn unity basics and  implemnt the player movment , jumping , simple ablity
	to interact , simple shooting method (in total 8+ hours of work ).
# week 2
    improve and fix bugs in the gun and shooting and make it more usable for extra guns in the future
	, improve the interact class and the interact layer in addition to new UI for the interact
	that pop up when the player is close to an 
    interactable object that shows the interact button and what it does . (in total 7 hours of work )
# week 3 
    work on the gun class , add muzzle flash , bullet trail , bullet hit effect , fix the raycast

	follow him and if the player is in range shoot him if the player is out of range go back the
	original and move randomly to find the player .
	(in total 6 hours of work ).
# week 6
    start to work on the powder game part using a system like SPH which was very slow and didnt work
	in the end so I deleted everything and decided to start over next week with a grid-based system.
	(in total 8 hours of work).
# week 7
    create the grid-based system using a 3d array , implement the camera movement for the grid word and  
	create a simple falling sand that fall from the sky and implement a sand behavior that contorl the  
	sand falling and movment logic , currently this behavior isnt perfect and some improvement.
	(in total 10 hours of work ).

 - improve and increase the size of the game grid 
 - create a gui to chose the elements and to clear the grid 
 - add 3 new elemnt :
    - water
    - snow
    - lava
